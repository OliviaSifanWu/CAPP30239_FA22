# Week 3

## Final Project Data Source
- Data source: 8a.nu Climbing Logbook https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dcohen21/8anu-climbing-logbook?resource=download
- Description of data: The data is scraped by a Kaggle user to collect all of the user and ascent information from the world's largest rock climbing logbook, https://www.8a.nu/. The datasets includes rock climbing ascent information on this website where users log their climbs including routes grade, climbers information, routes location, etc.
- Why you are interested in this topic: I am really into rock climbing now and passionate about outdoor rock climbing. I want to visualize this dataset to potentially summarize how the climbing community is like now. Where are the good climbing routes located? How the climbers are performed?
- Thoughts on how you would hope to use this data: I will use the ascent table in this dataset to see how hard are climbers can climbing and how good routes are spreaded in the whole world. I will also use the User table to have a glimpse at the composition of the climbing community.
- Potential data points: climb type, climb method, routes grad, climber sex, climber country, climber height and weight, etc.
- Any concerns about the data: 1) This data set is inherently biased. The data comes from a website where users log their climbs and the people who will go to the trouble of tracking this information on a website are very serious about their hobby. Hence, the data will suffer from self selection bias and it will tend to over represent the serious, strong climber. It will also over represent the geographic areas where 8a.nu is popular. 8a.nu is more popular in Europe than other areas as 8a is a reference to the French grading system. 2) The data size is a bit large. I may need to slice it for easier analysis.
- Identify if source is primary or secondary: secondary since it is web scraped from the original source.
- If secondary data, how you envision this data working with the primary source? Web scraping is complex for me and it is not the main focus for this course. If I have enough time, I may scraped the most recent data from the website by myself and use those for the project. But as far as I am planning, I will use the data scraped by others for my project to spend more time on data visualization.


## Bar Chart Exercise
- This project is using a bar chart to display library visits for the public libraries around the University of Chicago. 
- Data comes from the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Libraries-2022-Visitors-by-Location/ykhx-yxn9)
